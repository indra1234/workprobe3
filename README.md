# Embedded System & Microcontroller Projects : 03 Project  â€“ Paper Feeding Machine Control by PIC18F458 microcontroller and link to a Touch Panel.
## 03.1 Project Description:
- Project Name : Motor control using by PIC18F458 microcontroller and Touch panel.
- Skill : Sensor used proximity sensor and counter sensor,  programming used Embedded C, Hardware design Multisim, PCB design in Ultiboard, Microcontroller used PIC18F458.
- Application : In Industry, Biomedical, Automation industry, Aerospace etc. 
- Result : Completed.
- This project based on Paper Feeding Machine which rolls polythene/ papers to other machines in big industrial machines. The machine where the paper needs to be feed and for that needed control.That is the Picture of the paper Feeding machine where paper is mounted on shaft and the paper need to feed in the next machine. In here I had to control the feeding system in such a way to maintain the continuity of the paper in the next system so that paper don't touch the ground as well as paper should not breakup if the next machine is running is taking paper and our feeder is stopped. The machine should start and stops according to the next machine.
Here two types control are used 
        1. Automatic.
        2. Manual.
        3. Motor control speed.
        4 Start/Stop the whole system.

- I need to control a DC motor 24 volts with brush with the microcontroller PIC18F458 with the signal input from the two proximity sensors. The complete system needs to work in two mods. Automatic mode and manual mode. In automatic mode the motor will automatically starts and stops with the sensor signal input from the either sensors. In manual mode the motor would be operated by the operator bye a push button called Jog mode. When the push button is pressed the motor will start and when the push button released the motor will stops.
Here two proximity sensors are used for automatic motor(24VDC) control. Here two sensors are described as upper sensor and lower sensor.
  ## Working Principle of sensors:                                                    
         Upper sensor                      Lower Sensor                  Result

          covered                           covered                   Motor start

          uncovered                         covered                   No result

          covered                           uncovered                 Motor start

          uncovered                         uncovered                 Motor stop
- Upper sensor is used to stop the machine then uncovered and lower sensor is used to start the machine then covered.  Another sensor counter sensor is used for paper count. In every paper have a hole or black spot. When the paper hole or black spot is detect by the counter sensor then counter sensor gives a value 0 or 1 and microcontroller count the value and display the value in TFT screen. Every 500 times the count the paper hole the machine should be stopped.
For manual control in here TFT screen is used. In here two button is created one is start button and another is stop button.
